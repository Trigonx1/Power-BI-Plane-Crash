![Slide1](https://github.com/Trigonx1/Power-BI-Retail-Fashion-Project/blob/main/173084446.0.1415060900.webp)

##  Introduction
This is a Power BI project on Airplane Crash analysis over a time series of Plane Crash leading to Fatalities, Airplane Crash for 110 consecutive years (1910 and 2020).This dataset contains all of the plane crashes that happened throughout history. 


## Data Source:
The data used in this project is a modified dataset known as Airplane Crash;  
* Airplane Crash Sample Data [kaggle datasets download -d abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data)
* Modified Dataset used in this Project [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data/data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1xkWC6Jlk_YZECHbpUtoc8AEiPb9jfcld/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114068862415751566917&rtpof=true)

## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze airplane crashes over time, examining trends and identifying key factors that have influenced the frequency and severity of these incidents. By investigating historical data, the project seeks to answer the following key questions:
1. What are the primary causes of airplane crashes?
2. What risk factors are most strongly associated with airplane crashes?
3. How has the crash rate changed over specific time periods?
4. Which regions have experienced the highest number of fatalities due to airplane crashes?

## Power BI and Analytics Technical Skills:
+ Project Planning and Documentation
+ Data Gathering
+ Power Query
+ Data Modelling
+ Report Design
+ Data Visualization
+ Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
+ Business and Analytics Reporting
+ Performance Optimization
+ Deployment and Power BI Service
+ Feedback and Continuous Improvement
  
## Data Modelling
To optimize the performance of the data model, a DAX table was created using the DAX function. The dimension tables does not connect to the corresponding DAX table.
The diagram below shows the data model.

## Report Design and Visualization
The Report Canvas was designed in PowerBI as canvas background. Here is a sample of the slide in PowerBI

14 pages were created. 
On each page, the new card visual is used to hold Total Fatalities, PAX Fatalities, Crew Fatalities and Other Fatalities, Line Chart is used for the series analysis,the Donught Chart is used for survival comparison while a column and bar chart are adopted for the Cause, Crash site, Operator, and Country analysis respectively.

## Analytics and Insights
The data analysis revealed that;

1. **ÔªøTrend in Airplane Crashes (1910-2020):**

+ Airplane crashes were significantly higher in the early years (1910-1979). However, there was a sharp decline in crashes from 1980 to 2020, with incidents decreasing by 91.55% (a reduction of 2,872 crashes over 40 years).
+ **Insight**: This trend suggests that advancements in technology, the implementation of stricter safety regulations, and improved training programs have been effective in reducing the number of airplane crashes over time.

2. **Primary Causes of Crashes:**

+ Human factors were identified as the leading cause of airplane crashes, with 9,926 incidents. This is 1,483.09% higher than the category with the fewest incidents, "Other causes," which accounted for 627 crashes.
+ **Insight**: Despite technological advances, human error remains a significant concern in aviation safety.
  
3. **Geographic Distribution of Crashes:**

+ The total number of crashes varied across five countries, ranging from 848 to 6,804.
+ The United States experienced the highest number of crashes, with 6,804 incidents, representing 52.66% of the total fatalities.
+ **Insight**: The concentration of crashes in specific regions highlights the need for localized safety interventions.
  
4. **Crash Sites and Fatalities:**

+ Most crashes occurred near airports (within 10 km), with these incidents resulting in 13,590 fatalities, accounting for 47.62% of the total fatalities.
+ **Insight:** The proximity of crashes to airports suggests that critical phases of flight (takeoff and landing) are particularly vulnerable and require enhanced safety measures.
5. **Survival Rates:**

+ The survival rate in airplane crashes was low, with a fatality rate of 72.57%.
+ **Insight**: The high fatality rate underscores the importance of improving safety measures and emergency response protocols to increase the chances of survival.
6. **Operator with the Highest Casualties**:

+ The Royal Air Force (RAF) had the highest number of casualties, with 2,363 fatalities, accounting for 32.87% of crashes associated with a specific operator.
  + **Insight**: This statistic may reflect the particular risks associated with military aviation operations.

## Conclusions and Recommedations

1. Haut needs to conduct market analysis to increase sales in Q1 and Q2 and offer seasonal products that appeal to customers in the first half of the year
2. Haut‚Äôs management should continue their market strategy that leads to higher profits and better customer satisfaction
3. The cosmetics product category demands more research and development to boost its sales and profitability
4. Promotions (discounts) drive most of the sales in Haut stores, making them competitive in the dynamic market. Therefore, other promotional and marketing strategies should be implemented to enhance sales and profit
5. Products in Africa and China stores should be tailored to the specific needs of these markets through careful research
