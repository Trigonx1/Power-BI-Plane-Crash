so help ME GOD Thank You.
# Power-BI-Historical Plane Crashes 1918-2022

![Slide1](https://github.com/Trigonx1/Power-BI-Retail-Fashion-Project/blob/main/airplanbe%20crashicon.png)

##  Introduction
This is a Power BI project on Airplane Crash analysis over a time series of Plane Crash leading to Fatalities, Airplane Crash for 104 consecutive years (1918 and 2022).This dataset contains all of the plane crashes that happened throughout history. 


## Data Source:
The data used in this project is a modified dataset known as Airplane Crash;  
* Airplane Crash Sample Data [kaggle datasets download -d abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data)
* Modified Dataset used in this Project [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data/data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1xkWC6Jlk_YZECHbpUtoc8AEiPb9jfcld/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114068862415751566917&rtpof=true)

## Problem Statement
This project is aimed at analysing airplane crashes and how it has trended over the years, what concerns were addressed to mitigate these crashes and hence, answer the following questions;
1. To determine the Cause of Plane Crash?
2. To identify the associated risk factor of plane crash?
3. To determine the crash rate over a time duration?
4. Where does most Fatalities comes from in terms of region?


## Power BI and Analytics Technical Skills:
+ Project Planning and Documentation
+ Data Gathering
+ Power Query
+ Data Modelling
+ Report Design
+ Data Visualization
+ Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
+ Business and Analytics Reporting
+ Performance Optimization
+ Deployment and Power BI Service
+ Feedback and Continuous Improvement
  
## Data Modelling
To optimize the performance of the data model, a DAX table was created using the DAX function. The dimension tables does not connect to the corresponding DAX table.
The diagram below shows the data model.

## Report Design and Visualization
The Report Canvas was designed in PowerBI as canvas background. Here is a sample of the slide in PowerBI

14 pages were created. 
On each page, the new card visual is used to hold Total Fatalities, PAX Fatalities, Crew Fatalities and Other Fatalities, Line Chart is used for the series analysis,the Donught Chart is used for survival comparison while a column and bar chart are adopted for the Cause, Crash site, Operator, and Country analysis respectively.

## Analytics and Insights
The data analysis revealed that;

1. There is a zig-zag trend of profit across the months, however, October records the highest profit of ($3.74M) which is 15% of the total profit and April records the least profit of ($1.4M), 6% of total profit
2. There exist an increase in profit from 2013 to 2014 with a ration of 4:6
3. Q4 record the highest profit of ($8.4M) with Q1 with the lowest ($5M), this shows steady increase in profit across the quarter from 1 to 4
4. The most and least profitable product category are Stationery and Cosmetics which amounts to 44% and 28% of the total profits respectively 
5. By region continent is intended, therefore Haut supermarket makes the most sales from America region ($98M) with 47% of the total Gross Sales
6. This is achieved with the help of the slicer; which shows that product with discount result to 96% of the total Gross sales while only 4% don't have discount, with **High** band of discount amounting to 41% of the Gross Sales
7. Africa pull 9% of the total Gross sales and 6% of the total Profit from the 202,286 Units solds from South Africa and Nigeria. This is can be visualised when clicking on Africa in the column chart 
8. France is the most profitable Country among the Haut Stores with 20% ($4.9M) of the total profit

## Conclusions and Recommedations

1. Haut needs to conduct market analysis to increase sales in Q1 and Q2 and offer seasonal products that appeal to customers in the first half of the year
2. Haut‚Äôs management should continue their market strategy that leads to higher profits and better customer satisfaction
3. The cosmetics product category demands more research and development to boost its sales and profitability
4. Promotions (discounts) drive most of the sales in Haut stores, making them competitive in the dynamic market. Therefore, other promotional and marketing strategies should be implemented to enhance sales and profit
5. Products in Africa and China stores should be tailored to the specific needs of these markets through careful research

## Deployment to Power BI Service
